Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to submit my application for the DevOps Engineer position. With 4+ years of experience and proven track record of deploying, managing, and automating a wide range of services in a sophisticated home lab environment, I offer deep hands-on experience with containerization, CI/CD, and system monitoring.

My recent projects include designing and orchestrating production-grade Docker and Docker Compose stacks and Kubernetes stacks for self-hosted Gitea, multi-environment WordPress deployments, robust monitoring with Glances and Uptime Kuma, and advanced networking using Nginx Proxy Manager. I have automated deployment pipelines, implemented secure and scalable configurations, and ensured high availability for all critical services.

I am passionate about open source, system reliability, and continuous improvement. My home lab experience has equipped me with practical problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a proactive approach to infrastructure management. Experience with Linux operating systems including installing, configuring and troubleshooting. Experience working in an agile software development Environment. I am eager to bring my expertise to a collaborative team, contribute to innovative projects, and help drive operational excellence.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills can add value to your organization.

Sincerely,  
 Dickson Tamngwa
